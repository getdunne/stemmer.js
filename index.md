## Description

stemmer.js is a simple web app which allows simultaneous playback of multiple audio files (aka "stems"), with a simple GUI to allow the listener to adjust
each stem's volume, mute and solo individual stems, and start playback from any of several pre-defined _cue points_.

The audio playback code is based on [Howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js/). Responsive web layouts are based on
[Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

I don't claim that this is a great web app, or a particularly good example of Howler.js usage, or JavaScript code, or (certainly not) HTML/CSS. It's
simply a starting point for a specific use-case (simultaneous playback of multiple audio files) which is not well-covered by the Howler.js documentation.
I very much hope that more competent developers will improve on what I have started.
